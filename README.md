Simple Bet is a made-up game I am creating to test out AI concepts. It is essentialy a game of No-Limit Sit Nâ€™ Go One Card Draw (Multi-Deck) Poker. Once the game is complete, I will be writing an AI to play the game, to see if I can implement stastical thinking and gambling ideas into an AI agent.
